# Arduino Library for Maxim DS1390 real time clock - SPI mode

## Usage

All date and time values can be stored in a "DS1390DateTime" struct. This struct is defined in the header file.

All parameters that can be passed as arguments to functions expect to receive values defined in the header file. Ex: To disable the trickle charger, call the function "setTrickleChargerMode" and pass DS1390_TCH_DISABLE as argument. 

## Notes

This library uses the Century bit of the Month register as a way to check if the memory contents are valid. When date or time registers are written, this bit is set to 1. This bit is used to check if the device memory was lost since last time the registers were written (this bit is reseted to 0 when Vcc and Vbackup are lost).

A 200ms (min) delay is required after boot to read/write device memory (tRST).

Epoch related functions assume year is higher than 2000.

Works with DS1391 aswell.

Alarm-related functions not implemented yet.

## Known bugs
In 12h format, the device do not change the AM/PM bit neither increments the day of the week and day counters. Everything works in 24h mode.

Reading Hundredths of Seconds too often makes the device loose accuracy.
